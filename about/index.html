    <p>Excellent Portland developer Derek Nutile had a problem. Finding the right FontAwesome icon for projects is a less-than-efficient process. You have to visit the <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/">FontAwesome icon page</a> and visually sort through the growing list of hundreds of icons to find the right icon. Together with Dean Dowd he sought to create a resource for programmers and designers alike that sorts the list of icons to quickly find the right one for their job along with the appropriate meta data. FADBUS, which is another way of saying “Font Awesome Database” was born.</p>

		<p>Because of FADBUS, finding the right icon is as easy as using the filter to find the right icon and cut and paste the html markup. FADBUS always uses the most current library so the newest icons are always available.</p>

		<p>FADBUS, developed by Derek Nutile and designed by Dean Dowd, uses Bootstrap and Jekyll and can be <a href="https://github.com/fadbus/fadbus.github.io">forked on Github</a>.</p>

		<h2>How is FADBUS working for you?</h2>
